# DC Powersupply HM310P Controller

I bought a HANMATEK HM310P and also wanted to use the included software. Unfortunately I had to realize that this software is not usable in its form.
Therefore I decided to write my own software to control the power supply from the PC.
Now I want to share this software with you, so that everyone can use it.
Please check the CODE_OF_CONDUCT if you want to make changes.
